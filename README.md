# CS-for-background-subtraction

This project is done as a part of my BTech course curriculum. It's an partial implementation of the paper given by our course instructor.
The link for the paper is http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/Publications/Reddy_ECCV_2008.pdf. 

The objective of this project is to recover the object silhouettes (binary background subtracted images) based on compressed sensing theory which is fundamental in automatically tracking moving objects with applications in surveillance. The codes associated with this project are done in Python on the Jupyter platform.

The details of the videos uploaded are as follows:
dataset_video.avi ----> original dataset video
bs_time.avi       ----> Background subtraction done in time domain (xt - xb)
bs_cs.avi         ----> Background subtraction done from compressive sensing (final ouput)
